# collide
This is a game called Collide, which is a simulation consisting of 3 pieces on a gameboard: a Slider, a Jumper, and a Diag. The simulation ends when only one piece is left on the board, assuming that it has eliminated the other two pieces. I used classes and inheritance when coding this project.
